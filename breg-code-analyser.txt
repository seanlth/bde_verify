2-stage process
	Replace breg calls with a boolean literal 
	Remove breg header files and remove or simplify if-stmts that contained breg calls 


Replacer 
	Matches if-stmts with function calls in the condition 
	Matches if-stmts with variables in the condition 
	Matches assignment statements
	Matches variable declaration statements 
	
	Variable values are added to a map to track values 

	Breg calls are recognised by the function 'bregdb_eval_bbitcxt_bool_rv' 
	
	BREG_ON and BREG_OFF are supported by doing the macro expansion manually
	Once a breg has been found it's value is retrieved and is used in the replacement 
	The position of the bregs removed is recorded in a file with an offset 
	The offset is the difference between the old stmt and the new statement
	It's necessary to ensure the remover knows which if-stmts had breg calls

Remover 
	Removes header files 
	Matches every if-stmt
	Checks if the if-stmt contained a breg
	Checks if the if-stmt has been removed already as an else-if
	Checks if the if-stmt has been removed already as a nested if-stmt
	Either rebuilds the condition or rebuilds the if-stmt
	Pruning and rebuilding the condition is managed by the TreeManager class  
	All else-ifs that are removed are collected in a vector

Expr-tree
	TreeManager is used to interact with the expr_tree, holds clang objects 
	Allows the current node to be pruned and rebuilt
	ExprTree is a wrapper around each clang node in the expr
	Side-effect checking carried out on each function call in the tree


Side-effect-checker
	Checks for long functions, greater than 15 stmts 
	Checks for pointers or references to non-const variables as arguments 
	Checks for incrementing or decrementing non-local variables
	Checks for incrementing or decrementing non-local 
	Checks for pointer or reference declarations to non-const non-local variable
	Checks for assignments to global variables

Breg-options 
	Silent - no ouput displayed
	Ignore-side-effects - functions are removed regardless of side-effects
	Function-removal-warnings - displays result of side-effect checker 
	Condition-extraction - extract condition if functions have side-effects
	Overrides - CSV, UUID, Pricing-number, Machine-or-group
